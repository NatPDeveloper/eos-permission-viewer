### Ghost ###

Not sure why you ghosted. If you disagreed with the project, that's fine, we would have respected your decision and parted ways in an amicable fashion. But just ghosting all of us? Not a word? Insulting. We all had a gentleman's agreement on the project from the start. We would have liked to work with you on other things as well, this was simply an MVP to see how quickly we could get something out the door on something we were all interested in as well as to test how we worked together. If you didn't want to be associated, that's fine. But a bit of advice, for you, someone who's only been in the engineering game a short time, check yourself. Banging out code is one thing, but engineering maintainable, reusable, elegant and powerful code that others will be able to pick up and add value to, fast, is an entirely different ballgame, one in which you have quite a ways to go. Hopefully you learned a bit while working with me.
